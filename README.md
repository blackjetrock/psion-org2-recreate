Recreation of Psion Organiser 2 using RP Pico

This is a repository for the code of a recreation of the Psion Organsier 2. The recreation uses a RP Pico on a PCB that replaces the main
PCB of the organiser 2. This runs an emulator of the 6303 and organiser ROMs. The PCB is mated with a second PCB (the 'power' PSB) which has the slots 
that allow datapacks to be read (not written with the first version). It also holds a wifi module that should allow communication with a host over
wifi or maybe bluetooth.

The PCBs fit into the original organiser 2 case.

PCB artwork is in other repositories. The 6303 emulatior is also in another repository.
