// SVPP Information from various sources
//
// The SVPP rail can be in one of three states :-
//
//      -  OV if the PACON_B is high and the slots are switched off
//
//      -  4.5 volts when PACON_B is low, fed by the forward  diode  D2  from
//         the SVCC rail
//
//      -  21 volts when the SVPP regulator is switched on.
//
// PACON_B    is bit 7, port 6
// POB_PORT6  is bit 3, port 6
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// 9.3.2.6  Setting the Program Voltage (SVPP)
// 
// It is not recommended that users attempt to write their own code  to  write
// to  datapacks.   The  following information is only given for completeness.
// The 21V required for programming  EPROMs  is  generated  using  a  hardware
// "pump"  similar to those found in electronic flash guns.  After the pump is
// turned on you must wait for the voltage to reach the required  level  (like
// waiting for the ready light to appear on a flash gun).
// The following lines are used to control SVPP:
// 
//      1.  PORT 6 (POB_PORT6, address $17)-When Bit 3 of this port (SOE_B) is
//          set  high  together  with  SCA_ALARMHIGH,  21V  (if  generated) is
//          switched to SVPP.
// 
//      2.  Location $200 SCA_PULSEENABLE-Enables generation  of  21V  (starts
//          hardware pump)
// 
//      3.  Location $240 SCA_PULSEDISABLE-Disables generation of  21V  (stops
//          hardware pump)
// 
//      4.  Location $280 SCA_ALARMHIGH-Enables SVPP to  be  switched  to  21V
//          with SOE_B
// 
//      5.  Location $2C0 SCA_ALARMLOW-Disables SVPP being switched to 21V
// 
//      6.  PORT 5 (POB_PORT5, address $15).  Only one bit  of  this  port  is
//          associated with the datapack interface.
//          1.  ACOUT- When this bit (bit 1) is high this indicates the 21V  is
//              ready to be switched on to the packs.
// 
// 
// SCA_PULSEENABLE, SCA_PULSEDISABLE  etc,  are  activated  by  accessing  the
// relevant  memory  location  with either a read or write.  It is recommended
// the TST instruction is used, i.e.
// 
//      TST        SCA_PULSEENABLE         ; starts hardware pump
// 
//      TST        SCA_PULSEDISABLE        ; stops hardware pump
// 
// NOTE.  The packs must be turned on (PACON_B  low)  when  switching  21V  to
// SVPP.  Damage may result to the packs or Organiser if this is not done.
// The following sequence will switch SVPP to 21V:
// 
//      1.  Set SOE_B low, TST SCA_ALARMLOW-make sure initially switched off.
// 
//      2.  TST SCA_PULSEENABLE-start pump.
// 
//      3.  Wait for ACOUT to come high-wait until voltage is high enough.
// 
//      4.  TST SCA_PULSEDISABLE-stop pump.
// 
//      5.  TST SCA_ALARMHIGH and set SOE_B high-21V is now switched to SVPP.
// 
//      6.  Wait 5ms to allow the voltage to settle.
// 
// 
// TST SCA_ALARMLOW or setting SOE_B low will switch SVPP back to 5V.
// 
// _______
// WARNING The 21V should not be switched to SVPP while the pump is on as this
// can result in damage to the hardware.
// 
// After pumping, the voltage is stored in a capacitor.  This means  there  is
// only  a  limited  amount  of  energy  available  for  blowing EPROMs before
// repumping is required.  The operating system allows  for  24ms  of  blowing
// time  for  each  pump  cycle.  This will only be available after ACOUT goes
// high as the capacitor will discharge itself through leakage.
// 
// The pump charges a standard tolerance 100uF 40V electrolytic  capacitor  to
// 35V which is then regulated to 21V before being switched to SVPP.
// 
// ___
// NB.
// 
//      1.  If the 21V is switched to  SVPP  before  the  ready  condition  is
//          detected,  or  it  is  left  switched  on and not repumped, then a
//          voltage somewhere between 5V and 21V will  be  switched  to  SVPP.
//          This can result in a variety of disastrous effects (e.g. destruction
//          of data) depending on the conditions under which it occurs.
// 
//      2.  The  operating  system  keyboard   interrupt   routine   can   TST
//          SCA_ALARMHIGH under certain circumstances, so it is important that
//          in any  routine  where  SOE_B  may  be  high  interrupts  must  be
//          disabled.

// Rom
// 
// Both the LZ and LZ64 have 64k of ROM.  The ROM from $8000 to $BFFF
// is bank-switched in 3 banks of 16k and the ROM from $C000 to $FFFF
// is fixed. (see appendix C of the LZ(64) programming manual). The bank-switching

// 
//     $360    - Reset ROM/RAM to bank 0
//     $3E0    - Select next ROM bank
// 
// Note that the operating system may switch ROM banks when any system
// service is called and during interrupts.
// 
// *******************************************************************************
// Ram
// 
// The model LZ has 32k of RAM and the LZ64 has 64k. The RAM from $4000
// to $7FFF is bank switched in 3 banks of 16k and the RAM below $4000
// is fixed. (see appendix C of the LZ(64) programming manual). The bank-switching
// is carried out by accessing the following addresses (reading or writing):
// 
//     $360    - Reset ROM/RAM to bank 0
